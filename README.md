# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
In this project, you will implement your learnings to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn. The completed project will include a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package will also have the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).

## Files and data description

- churn_library.py - contains functions to find customers who are likely to churn
- churn_notebook.ipynb - notebook that needs to be refactored
- churn_script_logging_and_tests.py - unit tests for churn_library.py
- requirements_py3.6.txt - install needed libraries

Folders

- data - contains csv to find customers who are likely to churn
- images
    - eda - plots of exploratory data analysis
    - results - images of results of classification reports
